# Shopify Embedded App ‚Äì Product Status Toggle

## üß© Overview

This is a minimal Shopify embedded app built to demonstrate how to update product status using the Shopify Admin GraphQL API. The app connects to a store, lists the 10 most recent products, and allows the merchant to toggle their status between `ACTIVE` and `DRAFT` using a simple UI and GraphQL mutation.

## üéØ Goal

Build a lightweight Shopify embedded app that:

- Authenticates with the store (using Shopify‚Äôs Embedded App SDK).
- Lists the latest 10 products (showing title, price, and published date).
- Adds a toggle switch next to each product to change its status between `ACTIVE` and `DRAFT`.
- Uses the `productUpdate` GraphQL mutation to perform the update.
- Handles errors gracefully with toasts or alert messages.
